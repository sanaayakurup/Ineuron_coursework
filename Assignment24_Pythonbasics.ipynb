    "Function annotation is the standard way to access the metadata with the arguments and the return value of the function. These are nothing but some random and optional Python expressions that get allied to different parts of the function. They get evaluated only during the compile-time and have no significance during the run-time of the code. They do not have any significance or meaning associated with them until accessed by some third-party libraries. They are used to type check the functions by declaring the type of the parameters and the return value for the functions. The string-based annotations help us to improve the help messages."
